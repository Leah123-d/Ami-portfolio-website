        -  The hedonic treadmill is a psychological theory that describes how people tend to quickly return to a stable level of happiness after experiencing major life events. It's also known as hedonic adaptation.
        -  A rat race is for rats. We're not rats. We're human beings. Reject the insidious pressures in society that would blunt your critical faculties to all that is happening around you, that would caution silence in the face of injustice lest you jeopardies your chances of promotion and self-advancement.
